>What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Searching for someone on a list for a dinner reservation.  You'd have to search line by line until the correct name is found.

>What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Searching for your room in a hotel.  You go to your correct floor, but then reach an intersection that divides the rooms into two
groups.  You can then look for the room in one of the groups.

Three 

>Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Binary search would not work in this case as the list of items must first be sorted.  You'd have to search linear.

>Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Binary would be best for this search because the collection is sorted.  Linear in this case would take longer.
