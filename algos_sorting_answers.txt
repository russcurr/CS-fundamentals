>We talked about time complexity in a previous checkpoint, and how to get an idea of the efficiency of an algorithm. 
After looking at the pseudocode for the above sorting methods, identify why merge sort and quick sort are much more 
efficient than the others. Walking through each algorithm with a few sample collections may help.

merge sort and quicksort have a best and average case time complexity  
of `(O)n log n` which is better than `(O)n^2` average and worst case of the other sorting algorithms.

>All of the sorts addressed in this checkpoint are known as comparison sorts. Research bucket sort and explain how it works. 
What is the ideal input for bucket sort?

Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. 
Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket 
sorting algorithm. Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.
